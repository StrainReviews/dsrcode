# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)
**Core value:** Real-time session visualization on Discord with personality-driven status messages
**Current focus:** Phase 5 (Binary Distribution Pipeline)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 (binary-distribution) -- NOT STARTED
Plan: Not started

## Last Session

- Date: 2026-04-09
- Stopped at: Phase 5 context gathered (50 MCP-backed decisions, full dsrcode rename)
- Resume: Phase 5 planning via /gsd-plan-phase 5
- Next: /gsd-plan-phase 5 (old plans need replanning due to expanded scope)

## Decisions

- [Phase 1]: HTTP hooks over command hooks (bash+curl) for 10x faster activity tracking
- [Phase 1]: go:embed presets/*.json for single-binary distribution per D-24
- [Phase 1]: JSON format for presets enables editing without recompilation
- [Phase 1]: Each preset 200+ messages across all categories for rich rotation
- [Phase 1]: HashString for StablePick seed instead of timestamp (sessionID-based determinism)
- [Phase 1]: Channel-based debounce pattern (non-blocking send to buffered channel of 1)
- [Phase 1]: Synthetic session IDs (jsonl- prefix) for JSONL fallback sessions
- [Phase 1]: Discord rate limit (15s) enforced in debouncer goroutine, not in discord client
- [Phase 1]: External test packages for black-box testing across all packages
- [Phase 1]: Buttons field uses json:"-" tag with custom map serialization
- [Phase 1]: Config watcher watches directory not file for atomic-save editor compatibility
- [Phase 1]: X-Claude-PID header with os.Getppid() fallback for PID sourcing
- [Phase 2]: DisplayDetail enum with ParseDisplayDetail fallback to minimal for unknown values
- [Phase 2]: ExtractToolContext exported for external test package access
- [Phase 2]: Synthetic session_id uses http- prefix to distinguish from real UUIDs
- [Phase 2]: Preview duration clamped 5-300s with 60s default
- [Phase 2]: HTTP hooks with 1s timeout replace command hooks for 10x faster tracking
- [Phase 2]: Notification hook with idle_prompt matcher for idle state detection
- [Phase 2]: start.sh auto-update kills existing daemon before binary replacement
- [Phase 2]: atomic.Bool for discordConnected state
- [Phase 2]: cfgMu sync.RWMutex protects cfg reads in configGetter and displayDetailGetter closures
- [Phase 3]: Windows IsPidAlive uses tasklist command (os.FindProcess always succeeds on Windows)
- [Phase 3]: PID-based tracking (macOS/Linux) + refcount (Windows) for session count accuracy
- [Phase 3]: SetLastActivityForTest helper on registry for deterministic stale tests
- [Phase 4]: External test packages for all 8 analytics files
- [Phase 4]: json.RawMessage for Session struct analytics fields to avoid circular imports
- [Phase 4]: Spawn() preserves pre-set Status to support completed agents in SubagentTree
- [Phase 4]: Persist errors silently discarded: analytics loss is cosmetic, never blocks hooks
- [Phase 4]: SubagentStop route registered before wildcard /hooks/{hookType} for routing precedence
- [Phase 4]: SetTracker method for optional analytics injection without breaking constructor
- [Phase 4]: LoadPreset delegates to LoadPresetWithLang(name, en) for backward compat
- [Phase 4]: BilingualMessagePreset uses map[string]*MessagePreset for language selection
- [Phase 4]: ParseMessageFileBytes for embedded FS; parse errors logged as warnings

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1: Discord Rich Presence + Activity Status Plugin Merge (migrated from StrainReviewsScanner Phase 13)
- Phase 2: DSRCodePresence Setup Wizard (migrated from StrainReviewsScanner Phase 15)
- Phase 3: Fix Discord Presence session count and enhance demo mode (migrated from StrainReviewsScanner Phase 16)
- Phase 4: Discord Presence Enhanced Analytics (migrated from StrainReviewsScanner Phase 17)
- Phase 5: Binary Distribution Pipeline (migrated from StrainReviewsScanner Phase 18, pending)
- Phase 6: Hook System Overhaul (migrated from StrainReviewsScanner Phase 20, context only)
- Phase 7: GitHub Repo Transfer (new, to be planned)
